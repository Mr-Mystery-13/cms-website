 *      - IF the input field isn't blank add it to a temporary
 *        data object * 
 *      - prints the data object for good measure
 *      - updates the data object created to the Firebase database
 * 
 * Each property of the object should be that corresponding element's id.
 * @HINT we already have the references and the ids
 * 
 * @BONUS use an arrow function
